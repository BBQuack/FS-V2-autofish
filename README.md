# Firestone V2 AutoFisher

Welcome to the Firestone V2 AutoFisher! This tool is specifically designed to help you automate the fishing process in Roblox games. It works by monitoring changes in the visuals on your screen to detect when a fish bites. This guide will help new users understand how to set up and effectively use the AutoFisher.

## Quick Setup Guide

**Step 1: Positioning**
- Stand at the edge of a dock in Roblox, and make sure you're facing the water in first-person view.

**Step 2: Graphics Settings**
- For optimal performance, adjust your Roblox graphics quality to the lowest setting. This helps the AutoFisher detect changes more efficiently.

**Step 3: Boundary Setup**
- Use the center boundary setting to ensure that the fishing bobber is within this area towards the bottom of your screen.

**Step 4: Starting and Stopping**
- To start the AutoFisher, simply press `F4`. Press `F4` again to stop the tool.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Premature Clicking**: If the tool starts reacting too early, adjust the white percentage threshold in the settings. This will help delay the tool's response until a fish actually bites.
  
## Important Notes

- **Weather Sensitivity**: The tool struggles in rainy conditions. For uninterrupted fishing, position yourself under a bridge during rain.
- **Light Changes**: Transitions from day to night can affect detection. Keep an eye on this if you notice premature clicking.
- **Monitoring**: The AutoFisher is not fully autonomous and may require your supervision to ensure it operates correctly under varying game conditions.
