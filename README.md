# Firestone V2 AutoFisher

Welcome to the Firestone V2 AutoFisher! This tool is designed to automate fishing in Roblox games by detecting changes in the screen's visuals. Python 3.9

## How to Use

1. **Positioning**: Stand on the edge of a dock and look at the water in first person.
2. **Graphics Settings**: Set Roblox's graphic quality to the lowest to enhance the script's performance.
3. **Boundary Setup**: It is recommended to use the center boundary. Ensure that the fishing bobber is visible within the boundary towards the bottom.
4. **Starting the Tool**: Press `F4` to start the AutoFisher.

## Debugging

- If the AutoFisher starts clicking too soon (i.e., before a fish bites), you may need to increase the white percentage threshold in the settings to delay the response time.

## Notes

- **Weather Limitation**: The tool does not operate effectively in rain. If it's raining, try positioning yourself under a bridge to continue fishing.
- **Day Cycle**: When it's changing to day/night the light may mess it up and cause premature click. 
- **Reliability**: This tool is not 100% reliable (Don't leave it alone, it will break) and may require monitoring and adjustments based on different game conditions and setups.
- **Version**: 0.01
